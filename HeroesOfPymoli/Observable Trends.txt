Observable Trends

-It looks like just about 85% of the Gender is Male.  
-More than half of the total sample are between the ages of 20 to 30 years old.  
-They are also the ones doing most of the buying, in particular the 20-24 age group.  
-Interestingly though the Avg Total Purchase per Person is higher for the <10 age group and the
35-39 age group likely due to larger discretionary income of the parent / adult.  This winds up leading
to higher margins so definitely want to focus on pitching them.
